APPROACH:

Data Collection and Cleaning: Gathered agricultural data from various sources and used a Python script for cleaning, including handling missing values and standardizing units.

Data Modeling: Loaded cleaned data into Power BI and created a data model to establish relationships between different datasets, such as linking crop data with regional information.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed EDA to find trends and patterns in the data, identifying top-performing crops, high-yield areas, and regional disparities.

Visualization: Created a fully interactive dashboard in Power BI using various visualization types, including geographical heatmaps, line charts, and bar charts, to display key agricultural metrics like area, production, and yield.

User Interface (UI) Design: Implemented interactive elements such as slicers for filtering by crop type, region, and year, enhancing the user experience.

SQL Database: Used SQL best practices to design and populate a structured, normalized database containing the cleaned data.

Evaluation: Evaluated the project's success based on metrics like data visualization accuracy, user engagement, and dashboard performance.
